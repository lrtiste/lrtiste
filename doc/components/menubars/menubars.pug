    blockquote(cite='https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menu')
        p A menu that is visually persistent is a menubar. A menubar is typically horizontal and is often used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.
    P It can be seen as a composite of menuitems and #[a(href='#foo') dropdown menus]

        p The recommended keyboard interaction is quite complex and I recommend you to read directly from #[a(href='https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menu') WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices] which will explain it much better than I would.

        h2#lrtiste Menu bar using lrtiste
        p As a menu bar would be a set of grouped actions, it may not be relevant/easy to have it working without Javascript and we are going to consider for this example that Javascript is available.
        p There is a #[a(href='#aldjf') specification draft] on a eventually new #[code menu] html element whose read might help to understand what is expected for such a component.
